# Prices-Law-in-MLB-Roster-Construction

This was my Winter 2021 Stats 406 (Computational Methods in Statistics and Data Science) final project, in which I researched the distribution of WARs ([Wins Above Replacement](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/wins-above-replacement)) among Major League ballclubs from 2000-2019, determining if this distribution can be explained by a slight variation of [Priceâ€™s Law](https://dariusforoux.com/prices-law/).
